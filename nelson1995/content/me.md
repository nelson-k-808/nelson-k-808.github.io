Greetings, I'm Nelson Katale and I'm from Kampala, Uganda. This is my personal
blog website which I use to document my learnings and share my pet projects to the world.
 [All posts]({{< param allposts >}}) contains a list of posts I've documented here from the
latest to the oldest. You can also click the [Search]({{< param search>}}) to search for
posts by specific keywords. You can find more about my professional experience on my [LinkedIn
profile]({{< param linkedIn >}}).
