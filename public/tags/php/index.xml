      <description>A few years ago I had an old Laravel project that I built back in 2019. Back then I was still a junior developer and at that time I had no plans to host it. Fast forward to March 2024 I decided to host it in Heroku which I detailed in the last article .
One of my reasons for this post was to give a guide to help make the Laravel version upgrade experience as less time consuming, and straightforward as possible.</description>
